# Benchmarks for Web Applications and Web Server Applications

We created these to compare the Warp web server and the Yesod web framework with other web servers and frameworks.

Here is a blog of the PONG benchmark:

In our comparison, we tried to find the fastest servers in other languages. For python we used tornado. For Ruby we used Goliath. Here is an overview of [Ruby deployment options](http://blog.gregweber.info/posts/2011-06-16-high-performance-rb-part3). For Java we used winstone, although there may well be a better option.

In the future we would like to benchmark against Erlang and Nginx.
